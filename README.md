# Notebook Converter
This application is designed to convert Python scripts (.py) into Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) and vice versa. The motivation behind creating this tool stemmed from the lack of straightforward online converters that can handle this specific task effectively. By providing an easy-to-use interface, this tool aims to streamline the workflow for developers and data scientists who frequently switch between these two formats.

## Features

- Convert `.py` files to `.ipynb` notebooks.
- Convert `.ipynb` notebooks to `.py` scripts.
- User-friendly interface for file selection.
- Compatible with both Google Colab and local environments.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install p2j ipynb-py-convert
